## About the project

### OVERVIEW

Share the Iftar allows the community to share their iftar meal with others. Iftar at the Mosques were a community affair, providing a quality meal for the Fasting Muslim. With COVID 19 this will not be possible this year and many members from our community will suffer in shyness and silence. Staying hungry and not being able to afford regular meals, due to the current financial difficulties.
